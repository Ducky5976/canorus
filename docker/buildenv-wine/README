This folder contains Dockerfile for building windows-like development
environment for Canorus. It uses minimal Ubuntu docker image as a base and
using wine installs Qt SDK, Python and Swig for Windows.

To build the docker image locally, type:

docker build . -t buildenv-wine:latest

Once done, you can create and run a container using this image by:

docker exec -it buildenv-wine:latest /bin/bash

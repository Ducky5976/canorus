# Canorus Docker images

This folder contains Dockerfiles for building Canorus development environments.
They all use minimal Ubuntu/Windows docker images as a base and install Qt SDK,
cmake, Python and Swig.

To build the docker image locally, type:

docker build . -t canorus/<BUILDENV_NAME>:latest

Once done, you can create a container based on given image and run a command
by:

docker exec -it canorus/>BUILDENV_NAME>:latest /bin/bash

(The example above is for Ubuntu-based docker images.)
